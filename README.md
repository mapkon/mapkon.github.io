## Welcome Mark Gerard's Blog

Here, you will find the thoughts of a predicate felon? Probably thoughts of an itinerant engineer with some whacky and questionable experiences around the world.

But that is not why I am really blogging, the motivations are varied, but we can drill them thus ...

### Motivation

In 2020 to early 2021, I spent sometime learning Clojure and ClojureScript. However, the language was quite an effort for me to grokk. I parked it since I had other things to attend to. However, I came across this tutorial, which offers a way for me to use ClojureScript and github pages to write a blog. I thought that it was a good balance, since I can have a weekly interaction with ClojureScript, while also documenting my unsavoury thoughts for the whole world to judge.

I also have a few thoughts on software development owing to my heightened apetitite for reading every book I find. Thus I need a place to post some of mhy learning, in a documentation style (not the i am-posting-for-the-time-i-might-need-it schtick).

I hope you enjoy your time here.
